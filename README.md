# sqlalchemy-challenge
Starting homework and making decent progress. Getting to the last 12 months of precipitation seems like I will need to import some form of timedelta to get accurate years. Finished what I believe is about half of the assignment. The python file is written and now I need to create the api.

The app is coming along nicely. Mixing code from the last class of advanced SQL and chatgpt I can come up with the correct syntax without too much issues.

Should be all finished up, just have to test it out and were good to go. If I want to get tutors more then I need to schedule the sessions on Wednesday at the latest.
